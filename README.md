# About Me

Hi, I'm Marco Mistretta, an AI enthusiast and dedicated PhD student at [MICC](https://www.micc.unifi.it/). My research focuses on Multimodal Learning, Natural Language Processing, Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning, and Incremental Learning. I am particularly passionate about developing cutting-edge techniques for few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models, which I find incredibly useful in this era of exponentially growing large models.

## Background

With a solid foundation in Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, I am committed to advancing the field through pioneering research. As a researcher, I aim to explore innovative solutions to complex problems, striving to make a positive impact on society.
